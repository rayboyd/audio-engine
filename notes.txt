1.  **Overall Energy / Loudness:**
    *   **What:** Measures the overall amplitude or power of the signal in a buffer. You're already calculating RMS in the `BeatDetector`.
    *   **Calculation:** RMS (Root Mean Square) for average loudness, Peak Amplitude for maximum instantaneous level.
    *   **Use/Visualization:**
        *   Drive a simple VU meter display.
        *   Control the overall brightness, size, or intensity of other visual elements (e.g., brighter spectrum on louder sounds).
        *   Send as: `{"type": "energy", "rms": 0.5, "peak": 0.9}`.

2.  **Band Energy:**
    *   **What:** Calculates the energy/loudness within specific frequency ranges (e.g., Sub-Bass, Bass, Mid, Treble).
    *   **Calculation:** Sum the magnitudes from the FFT results within predefined frequency bins corresponding to each band.
    *   **Use/Visualization:**
        *   Drive separate visual elements for different frequency ranges (e.g., a pulsing effect for bass, shimmering for highs).
        *   Control the color or shape of parts of the visualization based on the balance of frequencies.
        *   Send as: `{"type": "band_energy", "sub": 0.8, "bass": 0.6, "mid": 0.3, "high": 0.4}`.

3.  **Transient Detection:**
    *   **What:** Detects sharp, sudden increases in signal energy, often corresponding to the start ("attack") of sounds like drum hits, plucks, or even sharp vocal consonants. More sophisticated than simple energy thresholding.
    *   **Calculation:** Often involves looking at the rate of change in energy or spectral content (Spectral Flux is common). Algorithms like those in Aubio are designed for this.
    *   **Use/Visualization:**
        *   Trigger brief visual flashes, particle bursts, or sharp movements synchronized with the transients.
        *   Could be sent as events similar to the beat detector: `{"type": "event", "name": "transient", "strength": 0.7}`.

4.  **Spectral Centroid:**
    *   **What:** The "center of mass" of the spectrum. It indicates where the average frequency concentration is, relating to the perceived "brightness" of the sound.
    *   **Calculation:** Weighted average of frequency bins, using magnitudes as weights.
    *   **Use/Visualization:**
        *   Control the overall color hue of the visualization (e.g., bluer for higher centroid/brighter sounds, redder for lower centroid/darker sounds).
        *   Plot its value over time as a line graph.
        *   Send as: `{"type": "centroid", "value": 1500.5}` (value in Hz).

5.  **Spectral Flux:**
    *   **What:** Measures how quickly the shape of the spectrum is changing from one frame to the next. High flux often indicates an onset or transient.
    *   **Calculation:** Calculate the difference (e.g., Euclidean distance) between the magnitude spectrum of the current frame and the previous frame.
    *   **Use/Visualization:**
        *   Similar to transients, can drive the intensity or frequency of flashes, pulses, or other reactive elements.
        *   Send as: `{"type": "flux", "value": 0.85}`.

6.  **Key Detection (as you mentioned):**
    *   **What:** Estimates the musical key (e.g., C Major, A minor) of the audio.
    *   **Calculation:** More complex, typically involves calculating a Chromagram (energy per pitch class) and matching it against predefined key profiles. Libraries like Aubio often have functions for this.
    *   **Use/Visualization:**
        *   Display the detected key and potentially a confidence score.
        *   Could subtly influence the color palette of the visualization to match the key's mood (though this is subjective).
        *   Send as: `{"type": "key", "key": "Amin", "confidence": 0.75}`.

Adding processors for Overall/Band Energy and Transients/Flux would likely provide the most immediate visual impact alongside the FFT and BPM data.
